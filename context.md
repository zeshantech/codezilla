i wanna develop leetcode clone but with AI
we will give context to AI and AI will be return problem to US
user can select complexity, topics, and other more things to generate problem and we will provide proper prompt to AI
user can see their skills (generate with AI)
user can see his languages (which used to complete solve problem)
for now skip auth (we will impletement later - use static identity of user)
a comprehensive settings (skip for now)
a great, comprehensive and complex playground (like in a professional platform)
